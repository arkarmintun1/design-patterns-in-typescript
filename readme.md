# Design Patterns in TypeScript

- Reference: **Head First Design Patterns**

## OO Design Principles

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes
- Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends
